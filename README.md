# Inventory-Customer-Management-System

This is an academic project for Data Structures, focused on using Java to manage TV inventory and customer return data using key data structures such as HashMaps, TreeSets, MaxHeaps, and Binary Trees.

## 🔧 Features

- Manage TV inventory using object-oriented classes (`TV`, `TVType`, `TVReturn`)
- Load and parse customer and product data from external text files
- Track returned TVs and customer records with fast lookups
- Use custom implementations of:
  - `BinaryTree` for hierarchical data
  - `MaxHeap` for managing priority items
  - `HashMap` and `TreeSet` for fast data access and sorting

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Java (JDK 8+)
- File I/O
- Custom data structure implementation

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ)
2. Ensure all `.txt` files are in the root directory or correctly referenced in your code
3. Compile and run `Lab_7_SetsandMaps.java`
4. View results in the console
